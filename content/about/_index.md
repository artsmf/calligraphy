<center><h4>In a world of evites and emails, nothing sings "special" like a calligraphed wedding suite.</h4></center>
<br>

>I think of each wedding invitation as a piece of art representing your life together. Beautiful calligraphy and illustration makes it feel like you and conveys the poignancy of this milestone to your guests.

Hello! I'm Susannah Fisher, a romantic who loves celebrating life's most poignant moments - weddings, births, housewarmings, and more - with beautiful ephemera. I studied calligraphy with such masters as Suzanne Cunningham and Paul Antonio, and I specialize in modern calligraphy with an organic, Art Nouveau flair.
