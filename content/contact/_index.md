Fill out this form, and tell me all the details of your big day, your paper dreams, and anything else you want me to know and Iâ€™ll respond within 24 hours. If you just have a general question, or are interested in working with me for a styled shoot, [you can send me an email](mailto:info@violettebelle.com).

I book calligraphy projects anywhere between 5 weeks and 16 months in advance. However as a one-woman operation, my calendar books up quickly! I usually recommend reaching out through this form at least 4-6 months before your wedding/event date so we can book your project and save your spot in my schedule. Need it sooner that 4 months? No worries - send me an inquiry and I'll let you know if I am available for your date.
