Start your post with an attention-grabbing opening that empathizes with a problem or desire in the readerâ€™s mind. Use short sentences and paragraphs together with the occasional rhetorical question to draw the reader into the post. 

<!--more-->

## Subhead
Please use Heading 2 for the first level of the subhead (as above).
### Sub-subhead
Then Heading 3.
### Sub-sub-subhead
Then Heading 4, etc.
...
## Final Subhead
End your post with a motivational closing that echoes the problem/desire from the headline and opening, reminds the reader of the action they need to take, and encourages them to take the first step right away.
